Normally in corporate environment,there are restrictions in accessing internet directly from a browser. Often they are routed through proxy servers.Now this causes problem when we install SBT and want to use libraries from repositories.

So here goes some of the tricks to have a smooth install and working of SBT.

- Download latest SBT zip from <http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html>
- Unzip the package and ensure that you add the path of sbt\bin in your %PATH% enviornment variable.
- Ensure that you have appropriate version of JAVA. This can be checked by using the command `java -version`
- Set the following in  `.sbt\conf\sbtconfig.txt`

```
# Set the extra SBT options
-Dsbt.repository.secure=false
-Dsbt.log.format=true
-Dhttps.proxyHost=<your proxy server>
-Dhttps.proxyPort=<your proxy server port>
-Dhttp.proxyHost=<your proxy server>
-Dhttp.proxyPort=<your proxy server port>
```

- Set the repositories in `.sbt\repositories`. .sbt folder is the place where SBT downloads the libraries.

```
[repositories]
local
maven-central: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/

```

Thats it!!

Use sbt from your consoleâ€¦ and Enjoy using Scala.
