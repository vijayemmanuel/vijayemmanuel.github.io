Normally in corporate environment,there are restrictions to access internet directly from your IDE. Often they are routed through proxy servers. Configuring your IDE to connect to internt can cause lot of researching time and sometimes even leading to no solution. Here I explain how to deal with the configuration with SBT in Intellij IDE on Windows OS.

- Download latest Intellij Community edition IDE from <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/> and install
- Download JDK and install. Check installation by using the command `java -version`
- Download latest SBT zip from <http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html> and unzip the SBT package in a known location
- Go to your user home directory, usually C:\Users\<_username_>\ and create a folder with name '.sbt'. Under it create a file named 'repositories'

Add the following contents to it

```
[repositories]
local
maven-central: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/
```

- Open Intellij Idea IDE and configure the proxy settings. Install Scala plugin and restart

- After restart, open a dummy SBT project and go to Settings

Configure JVM JRE from the JDK location

Configure VM parameters 

```
-Dhttps.proxyHost=<your proxy server>
-Dhttps.proxyPort=<your proxy server port>
-Dhttp.proxyHost=<your proxy server>
-Dhttp.proxyPort=<your proxy server port>
-Dhttp.proxyUser=<your username>
-Dhttp.proxyPassword=<your password>
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<location to you Java trust store>
```

Configure Launcher to Custom and set the path to sbt-launcher.jar from the SBT zip location downloaded before.

- For the setup of the Java trust store follow the process below

1. Go to the site https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ and download the certificate from the browser in DER encoded binary X.509 format
2. Make a back up of the Java keystore file. The Java keystore is located at %JAVA_HOME%\lib\security\cacerts where %JAVA_HOME% is the JDK installed location
3. Import the good proxy root certificate. In a command prompt naviate to JDK installation location and type 

```
bin\keytool.exe -importcert -trustcacerts -file "<drive:\cert.cer>" -keystore <backup copy of cacerts> -alias <alias name> -storepass changeit
```

The -alias value must be unique in the destination keystore. If it is duplcated, you might experience import errors. You can output the cacerts to a text file to manually confirm the existing certificates using a text editor. Type

```
bin\keytool.exe -list -v -keystore <backup copy of cacerts> <output location\cacertsoutput.txt>
```

- Build the SBT project. Normally you should see that the build should successful after SBT downloads the library references from Maven repo. 

If you see the message like this below, check the setup of Java trust store and retry.

```
download error: Caught javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderExcepton: .....
[error] [launcher] could not retrieve sbt ....
```


Thats it!!

Use sbt from your Intellij IDE and Enjoy using Scala.
